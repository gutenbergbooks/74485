<p><span class="smcap large">This</span> <i>Handy Dictionary of Mythology</i> is intended to
supply the everyday reader with concise accounts of
the gods and goddesses of the ancients in an accessible
form.</p>

<p>Besides confronting us at every turn in the museums
and picture galleries, these deities and heroes
are constantly mentioned by poets and portrayed
by painters and sculptors, and they are used for the
purpose of illustration in the literature of the day.
Nothing is more common than to find the comic
newspapers resorting to Mythology for subjects for
their pictures; and quite recently <i>Punch</i> has given
us some delightful cartoons by Tenniel, which, apart
from the admirable drawing, are intensely amusing
to people who know enough of Mythology to see
the drift of the artist. For example, there is a cartoon
representing Æacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus
sitting in judgment on the unlucky electioneering
bribers, and underneath is the word “Nemesis.”
Again, there was a capital cartoon representing the
“Judgment of Paris,” in which the Duke of Richmond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
Earl Cairns, and Lord Salisbury figure as
Juno, Minerva, and Venus. This had reference to
the selection of a Conservative Leader for the House
of Lords, and was very popular. In order fully to
enjoy similar works, and to appreciate the allusions,
it is necessary that we should be able to find out
readily something about these mythological beings.
But to ascertain this “something” we do not want
to waste time in wading through such a number of
volumes as the compiler has used in making this
Dictionary, even if it were possible to get access to
them.</p>

<p>It has been a matter of astonishment to him to find
how many different versions there are of the same
fable, and to see how often various writers attribute
the same actions to different gods or heroes. In fact,
it has frequently been a difficult task to decide
which version should be adopted,—which authority
accepted. It may therefore be desirable to state
that where doubts have arisen, either the various
versions are given, or else Lempriere’s <i>Classical Dictionary</i>
has been referred to, to decide the questions.
Besides Lempriere, the following works, with many
others of less authority, have been consulted in compiling
this Dictionary:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Poetical Histories.</span> “Written originally in
French by the learned Jesuit, <span class="smcap">P. Galtruchius</span>.”
Translated into English by <span class="smcap">Marius d’Assigny</span>,
B.D. Second edition, 1672.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pantheon.</span> Representing the fabulous histories
of the Heathen Gods in a plain and familiar
method. By <span class="smcap">Andrew Tooke</span>, A.M. 1713.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A New Pantheon</span>; or, Fabulous History of
Heathen Gods, Heroes, and Goddesses. By
<span class="smcap">Samuel Boyse</span>, A.M. 1753.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mythological, Etymological, and Historical
Dictionary.</span> By <span class="smcap">W. Howell</span>, B.D. 1793.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rowden’s Pagan Deities.</span> 1820.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, supposing that all these books were accessible
to the general reader, it would still be in many
instances impossible for him, without considerable
labour, to find therein much of the information contained
in this Dictionary, for some of the best of
them have no index, but this book is an index to
them all.</p>

<p>The proper pronunciation of the names being important,
the accent is always marked; and the illustrative
quotations from the poets have been specially
selected with the intention of assisting the reader in
finding out the number of syllables in a name, and
by this means fixing the pronunciation.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the compiler has not confined
himself to Greek and Roman Mythology, but has
included the more important of the Egyptian,
Scandinavian, and Hindoo deities, references to which
often occur in modern literature.</p>

<p>The limited space at command has made it necessary
to be as concise as possible, but every name connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
with Mythology, of any note at all, has, it is
hoped, been included, and care has been taken to
avoid repetitions as much as possible. Where two
or three names occur in connection with one fable,
the tale is told once, and reference is made to it under
the name of the other deities concerned therein.</p>

<p>There are a few names inserted which, though not
strictly mythological, are mentioned because it frequently
happens that in the history of ancient heroes
there is something fabulous in the tales told concerning
them.</p>

<p>As to some of the gods and heroes, the <i>Handy
Classical Dictionary</i> and <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i> (part of
this Series of Handy Books) may be consulted with
advantage for fuller information; and it is hoped that
the popularity of those two books will be at least
equalled by the <i>Dictionary of Mythology</i>.</p>

him, when an infant, into the Stygian pool, which
made him invulnerable wherever the waters had

was one of the few great captains who escaped
the destruction of Troy. He behaved with great
valour during the siege, encountering Diomed,
and even Achilles himself. When the Grecians
had set the city on fire Æneas took his aged father,
Anchises, on his shoulders, whilst his son, Ascanius,
and his wife, Creusa, clung to his garments. He
saved them all from the flames. After wandering
about during several years, encountering numerous
difficulties, he at length arrived in Italy, where he
was hospitably received by Latinus, king of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Latins. After the death of Latinus Æneas became
king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Æo′lus</span> was the god of the winds. Jupiter was his
reputed father, and his mother is said to have been
a daughter of Hippotus. Æolus is represented
as having the power of holding the winds confined
in a cavern, and occasionally giving them liberty
to blow over the world. So much command was
he supposed to have over them that when Ulysses
visited him on his return from Troy he gave him,
tied up in a bag, all the winds that could prevent
his voyage from being prosperous. The companions
of Ulysses, fancying that the bag contained
treasure, cut it open just as they came in sight of
Ithaca, the port they were making for, and the
contrary winds rushing out drove back the ship
many leagues. The residence of Æolus was at
Strongyle, now called Strombolo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Æscula′pius</span>, the god of physic, was a son of Apollo.
He was physician to the Argonauts in their famous
expedition to Colchis. He became so noted for
his cures that Pluto became jealous of him, and
he requested Jupiter to kill him with a thunderbolt.
To revenge his son’s death Apollo slew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Cyclops who had forged the thunderbolt. By his
marriage with Epione he had two sons, Machaon
and Podalirus, both famous physicians, and four
daughters, of whom Hygeia, the goddess of health,
is the most renowned. Many temples were
erected in honour of Æsculapius, and votive
tablets were hung therein by people who had been
healed by him; but his most famous shrine was
at Epidaurus, where, every five years, games
were held in his honour. This god is variously
represented, but the most famous statue shows
him seated on a throne of gold and ivory. His
head is crowned with rays, and he wears a long
beard. A knotty stick is in one hand, and a staff
entwined with a serpent is in the other, while a
dog lies at his feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Altar.</span> A structure on which a sacrifice was offered.
The earliest altars were merely heaps of earth or
turf or rough unhewn stone; but as the mode
of sacrificing became more ceremonious grander
altars were built. Some were of marble and
brass, ornamented with carvings and bas-reliefs,
and the corners with models of the heads of animals.
They varied in height from two feet to
four, and some were built solid; others were made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
hollow to retain the blood of the victims. Some
were provided with a kind of dish, into which
frankincense was thrown to overpower the smell
of burning fat. This probably was the origin of
the custom of burning incense at the altar.</p>

milk and new wine. After harvest there was
another festival, at which Ceres was presented
with the first-fruits of the season. See Ceres.</p>

was known by several names, but principally by
the following:—Sol (the sun); Cynthius, from the
mountain called Cynthus in the Isle of Delos, and
this same island being his native place obtained for
him the name of Delius; Delphinius, from his occasionally
assuming the shape of a dolphin. His
name of Delphicus was derived from his connection
with the splendid Temple at Delphi, where he
uttered the famous oracles. Some writers record
that this oracle became dumb when Jesus Christ
was born. Other common names of Apollo were
Didymæus, Nomius, Pæan, and Phœbus. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Greeks called him Agineus because the streets were
under his guardianship, and he was called Pythius
from having killed the serpent Python. Apollo is
usually represented as a handsome young man
without beard, crowned with laurel, and having in
one hand a bow, and in the other a lyre. The
favourite residence of Apollo was on Mount Parnassus,
a mountain of Phocis, in Greece, where he
presided over the Muses. Apollo was the accredited
father of several children, but the two most
renowned were Æsculapius and Phæton.</p>

got older he was set by his master Eurystheus
what were thought to be twelve impossible tasks,
which have long been known as the “Twelve
Labours of Hercules.” They were:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>First</i>, To slay the Nemean Lion.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, To destroy the Hydra which infested the
marshes of Lerna.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, To bring to Eurystheus the Arcadian Stag
with the golden horns and brazen hoofs.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, To bring to his master the Boar of Erymanthus.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, To cleanse the stable of King Augeas, in
which 3000 oxen had been kept for thirty years,
but had never been cleaned out.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>, To destroy the Stymphalides, terrible carnivorous
birds.</p>

<p><i>Seventh</i>, To capture the Bull which was desolating
Crete.</p>

<p><i>Eighth</i>, To capture the mares of Diomedes, which
breathed fire from their nostrils, and ate human
flesh.</p>

<p><i>Ninth</i>, To procure the girdle of Hippolyta, queen
of the Amazons.</p>

<p><i>Tenth</i>, To bring to Eurystheus the flesh-eating
oxen of Geryon, the monster king of Gades.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh</i>, To bring away some of the golden apples
from the garden of the Hesperides.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth</i>, To bring up from Hades the three-headed
dog, Cerberus.</p>
</div>

<p>All these tasks he successfully accomplished, and,
besides, he assisted the gods in their wars with the
giants. Several other wonderful feats are mentioned
under other headings, as Antæus, Cacus,
etc. His death was brought about through his
endeavours to preserve Deianira from the attacks
of Nessus, the centaur, whom he killed. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
centaur, before he expired, gave his mystic tunic
to Deianira, who in turn gave it to Hercules, and
he put it on, but his doing so brought on an illness
of which he could not be cured. In a fit of desperation
he cast himself into a funeral pile on Mount
Æta; but Jupiter had him taken to heaven in a
four-horse chariot, and only the mortal part of
Hercules was consumed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ja′son</span> was son of Æson, king of Iolcos; he was
brought up by the centaur Chiron. His uncle Æta
sent him to fetch the Golden Fleece from Colchis
(see Argonauts). He went in the ship Argo with
forty-nine companions, the flower of Greek youth.
With the help of Juno they got safe to Colchis,
but the King Ætes promised to restore the Golden
Fleece only on condition that the Argonauts performed
certain services. Jason was to tame the wild
fiery bulls, and to make them plough the field of
Mars; to sow in the ground the teeth of a serpent,
from which would spring armed men who would
fight against him who ploughed the field of Mars;
to kill the fiery dragon which guarded the tree on
which the Golden Fleece was hung. The fate of
Jason and the rest of the Argonauts seemed certain;
but Medea, the king’s daughter, fell in love with
Jason, and with the help of charms which she gave
him he overcame all the difficulties which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
king had put in his way. He took away the
Golden Fleece and Medea also. The king sent
his son Absyrtus to overtake the fugitives, but
Medea killed him, and strewed his limbs in his
father’s path, so that he might be delayed in collecting
them, and this enabled Jason and Medea
to escape. After a time Jason got tired of Medea,
and married Glauce, which cruelty Medea revenged
by killing her children before their father’s eyes.
Jason was accidentally killed by a beam of the ship
Argo falling on him.</p>

She was married to Jupiter, and became queen of
all the gods and goddesses, and mistress of heaven
and earth. Juno was the mother of Mars, Vulcan,
Hebe, and Lucina. She prompted the gods to
conspire against Jupiter, but the attempt was
frustrated, and Apollo and Neptune were banished
from heaven by Jupiter. Juno is the goddess of
marriage, and the protectress of married women;
and she had special regard for virtuous women.
In the competition for the celebrated Golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Apple, which Juno, Venus, and Minerva each
claimed as the fairest amongst the goddesses, Juno
was much displeased when Paris gave the apple

riding in a chariot drawn by peacocks, with a
diadem on her head, and a sceptre in her hand.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ju′piter</span>, son of Saturn and Cybele (or Ops), was

with the help of Hercules, defeated the giants, the
sons of earth, when they made war against heaven.
Jupiter was worshipped with great solemnity
under various names by most of the heathen
nations. The Africans called him Ammon; the
Babylonians, Belus; and the Egyptians, Osiris
(see Jove). He was represented as a majestic personage
seated on a throne, holding in his hands a
sceptre and a thunderbolt; at his feet stood a spread
eagle.</p>

from the celestial regions, after having conspired
with Pluto to dethrone Jupiter. Neptune was

Tethys, by whom he had a son named Triton.
He was also father of Polyphemus (one of the

the two functions of the god are portrayed in the
sea-horses with which his chariot is drawn, the

<p><span class="smcap">Pan.</span> The Arcadian god of shepherds, huntsmen, and
country folk, and chief of the inferior deities, is
usually considered to have been the son of Mercury
and Penelope. After his birth he was
metamorphosed into the mythical form in which
we find him depicted, namely, a horned, long-eared
man, with the lower half of the body like a goat.
He is generally seen playing a pipe made of reeds
of various lengths, which he invented himself, and
from which he could produce music which charmed
even the gods. These are the Pan-pipes, played
by Punch and Judy showmen. Pan’s terrific
appearance once so frightened the Gauls when they
invaded Greece that they ran away though no one
pursued them; and the word <i>panic</i> is said to have
been derived from this episode. The Fauns, who
greatly resembled Pan, were his attendants.</p>

She was taught singing by Apollo, and Mercury
taught her oratory. Jupiter gave her a box, the
famous “Pandora’s Box,” which she was told to
give to her husband, Epimetheus, brother of
Prometheus. As soon as he opened it there issued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
from it numberless diseases and evils which were
soon spread all over the world, and from that

<p><span class="smcap">Panthe′on.</span> The temple of all the gods, built by
Agrippa at Rome, in the reign of Augustus. It
was 144 feet in diameter, and 144 feet high; and
was built in the Corinthian style of architecture,
mostly of marble; while its walls were covered

<p><span class="smcap">Par′cæ, The</span>, were goddesses who presided over the
destiny of human beings. They were also called
the Fates, and were three in number, Atropos,
Clotho, and Lachesis. See Fates.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Par′is</span> was son of Priam, king of Troy, and his
mother was Hecuba. It had been predicted that
he would be the cause of the destruction of Troy,
and his father therefore ordered him to be
strangled as soon as he was born; but the slave
who had been entrusted with this mission took
the child to Mount Ida, and left it there. Some
shepherds, however, found the infant and took
care of him. He lived amongst them till he had
grown to man’s estate, and he then married
Œnone, a nymph of Ida. At the famous nuptial
feast of Peleus and Thetis, Discordia, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
not been invited, attended secretly; and when
all were assembled, she threw amongst the
goddesses a golden apple, on which was inscribed
“Let the fairest take it.” This occasioned a great
contention, for each thought herself the fairest.
Ultimately, the contestants were reduced to three,
Juno, Pallas (Minerva), and Venus; but Jove
himself could not make these three agree, and it
was decided that Paris should be the umpire. He
was sent for, and each of the goddesses courted
his favour by offering all sorts of bribes. Juno
offered him power, Pallas wisdom, and Venus
promised him the most beautiful woman in the
world. Paris gave the golden apple to Venus.
Soon after this episode Priam owned Paris as his
son, and sent him to Greece to fetch Helen, who
was renowned as being the most beautiful woman
in the world. She was the wife of Menelaus, king
of Sparta; but during his absence Paris carried
Helen away to Troy, and this gave rise to the celebrated
war between the Greeks and the Trojans,
which ended in the destruction of Troy. Paris
was amongst the 676,000 Trojans who fell during

<p><span class="smcap large">Sacrifices</span> were ceremonious offerings made to
the gods. To every deity a distinct victim was
allotted, and the greatest care was always taken
in the selection of them. Anything in any way
blemished was considered as an insult to the god.
At the time of the sacrifice the people were called
together by heralds led by a procession of musicians.
The priest, clothed in white, was crowned with a
wreath made of the leaves of the tree which was
sacred to the particular god to whom the sacrifice
was offered. The victim had its horns gilt, and
was adorned with a chaplet similar to that of the
priest, and was decorated with bright-coloured
ribbons. The priest then said, “Who is here?”
to which the spectators replied, “Many good
people.” “Begone all ye who are profane,” said
the priest; and he then began a prayer addressed
to all the gods. The sacrifice was begun by putting
corn, frankincense, flour, salt, cakes, and fruit
on the head of the victim. This was called the
Immolation. The priest then took a cup of wine,
tasted it, and handed it to the bystanders to taste
also; some of it was then poured between the
horns of the victim, and a few of the saturated
hairs were pulled off and put in the fire which
was burning on the altar. Then, turning to the
east, the priest drew with his knife a crooked line
along the back of the beast from the head to the
tail, and told the assistants to kill the animal.
This was done directly, and the entrails of the
victim taken out and carefully examined by the
Aruspices to find out what was prognosticated.
The carcase was then divided, and the thighs,
covered with fat, were put in the fire, and the rest
of the animal was cut up, cooked, and eaten.
This feast was celebrated with dancing, music, and
hymns, in praise of the god in whose honour the
sacrifice was made. On great occasions as many
as a hundred bullocks were offered at one time;
and it is said that Pythagoras made this offering
when he found out the demonstration of the
forty-seventh proposition of the book of Euclid.</p>

Homer’s Odyssey. His wife’s name was Penelope,
and he was so much endeared to her that he
feigned madness to get himself excused from going
to the Trojan war; but his artifice was discovered,
and he was compelled to go. He was of great
help to the Grecians, and forced Achilles from his
retreat, and obtained the charmed arrows of Hercules
from Philoctetes, and used them against the
Trojans. He enabled Paris to shoot one of them
at the heel of Achilles, and so kill that charmed
warrior. During his wanderings on his homeward
voyage he was taken prisoner by the Cyclopes, and
escaped, after blinding Polyphemus, their chief.
At Æolia he obtained all the winds of heaven,
and put them in a bag; but his companions,
thinking that the bags contained treasure which
they could rob him of when they got to Ithaca,
cut the bags, and let out the winds, and the ships
were immediately blown back to Æolia. After
Circe had turned his companions into swine on
an island where he and they were shipwrecked, he
compelled the goddess to restore them to their
human shape again. As he passed the islands of
the Sirens he escaped their allurements by stopping
the ears of his companions with wax, and
fastening himself to the mast of his ship. His
wife Penelope was a pattern of constancy; for,
though Ulysses was reported to be dead, she would
not marry any one else, and had the satisfaction of
finding her husband return after an absence of
about twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unknown God, An.</span> With reference to this GOD,
nothing can be more appropriate than St. Paul’s
address to the Athenians, as recorded in the 17th
chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Ye</i> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things
ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and
beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this
inscription, <span class="allsmcap">TO THE UNKNOWN GOD</span>. Whom therefore
ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God
that made the world and all things therein, seeing
that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in
temples made with hands; neither is worshipped
with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing,
seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to
dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of
their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if
haply they might feel after him, and find him, though
he be not far from every one of us: for in him we live,
and move, and have our being; as certain also of your
own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we
ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto
gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.
And the times of this ignorance God winked
at; but now commandeth all men every where to
repent: because he hath appointed a day, in the
which he will judge the world in righteousness by
<i>that</i> man whom he hath ordained; <i>whereof</i> he hath
given assurance unto all <i>men</i>, in that he hath raised
him from the dead.”</p>

She is said to have sprung from the foam of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
sea, and was immediately carried to the abode of
the gods on Olympus, where they were all charmed
with her extreme beauty. Vulcan married her,
but she permitted the attentions of others of the
gods, and notably of Mars, their offspring being
Hermione, Cupid, and Anteros. After this she
left Olympus and fell in love with Adonis, a
beautiful youth, who was killed when hunting a
wild boar. Venus indirectly caused the Trojan
War, for, when the goddess of discord had thrown
amongst the goddesses the golden apple inscribed
“To the fairest,” Paris adjudged the apple to
Venus, and she inspired him with love for Helen,
wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta. Paris carried
off Helen to Troy, and the Greeks pursued and
besieged the city (see Helen, Paris, and Troy).
Venus is mentioned by the classic poets under the
names of Aphrodite, Cypria, Urania, Astarte,
Paphia, Cythera, and the laughter-loving goddess.
Her favourite residence was at Cyprus. Incense
alone was usually offered on her altars, but if there
was a victim it was a white goat. Her attendants
were Cupids and the Graces.</p>

that he broke his leg, and was lame for ever
after. Vulcan was married to Venus. He is
supposed to have formed Pandora out of clay.
His servants were the Cyclops. He was the
patron deity of blacksmiths.</p>
